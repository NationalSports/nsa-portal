# Club Webstore Integration — Implementation Plan

Branch: `claude/webstore-inventory-integration-F0OkC`

## Goal

Native, portal-hosted webstores per club that:

1. Show live inventory from the portal's `products` table.
2. Surface incoming stock with ETA when an item is out (from open PO lines).
3. Drop orders directly into `sales_orders` / `so_items` — no external import.
4. Support **two checkout modes per store**:
   - **Paid** — parents pay at checkout via Stripe.
   - **Unpaid (coach order)** — items go on a coach-owned order, charged to the team / invoiced later.
5. Optional **fundraising mode** — coach toggles a markup; the delta is tracked per order and rolled up per store as `fundraise_total`.
6. Sales orders are created from cart submissions either **manually** (rep clicks "Create SO from cart batch") or **automatically on a schedule** (nightly / weekly / on store close).

Today, OMG (OrderMyGear) does this externally and we ingest its reports via
`netlify/functions/omg-store-ingest.js` → `omg_stores` / `omg_store_products`.
The native flow replaces that for portal-managed stores; OMG ingest stays for legacy.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

A separate React storefront route (`/shop/:storeSlug`) lives in the same repo and
deploys to the same Netlify site, served on a wildcard subdomain
(`*.shop.nsasports.com`). It reads from Supabase through a **public anon role
+ RLS** scoped to `webstore_*` tables and a read-only `storefront_products`
view — never the raw back-office tables. Checkout, label, batching, and
fundraising payouts all run as Netlify functions reusing the existing
`stripe-payment`, `shipstation-proxy`, and Supabase service-role plumbing.

**RLS policy summary:**

- `webstores`: public can `SELECT` rows where `status='open'`. Portal users (service role / authed staff) full access.
- `webstore_products` and `storefront_products` view: public `SELECT` only.
- `webstore_orders` / `webstore_order_items`: public can `INSERT` (checkout) and `SELECT` only their own row by id+email token. Portal staff full access.

> Note: column names like `po_lines.po_id`, `purchase_orders.expected_at`, and
> `products.size_stock` are placeholders — verify against the live schema during
> step 1 of the build and adjust the view definition. Today the AI Inventory PO
> Wizard already tracks "open POs"; we wire into whatever the actual columns are.

## Stock display logic (the "delayed → when it'll come in" piece)

For each (sku, size) tile:

```
on_hand        = products.size_stock[size]               (current stock)
open_po_qty    = sum of open PO line qty for that sku    (from product_eta)
earliest_eta   = MIN(expected_at) of those open POs

if on_hand >= 1                  → "In stock"
elif on_hand == 0 and open_po_qty
                                  → "Arriving ~<earliest_eta>" (still orderable, marked backorder)
else                              → "Sold out — notify me"  (email capture)
```

Backorder orders are accepted and flagged `backordered=true` on the
`webstore_order_items` row; they batch into the SO with a special line note so
fulfillment doesn't try to pick before the PO lands.

---

## Bundles / packages (group items with per-item sizing)

Many team stores sell a **package** at one price — e.g. "2 jerseys + 2 shorts +
socks + backpack." The buyer pays the single bundle price, but **sizes each
component independently** (jersey L, shorts M, socks one-size).

**Modeling:**

- A bundle is a `webstore_products` row with `kind='bundle'` and a single
  `retail_price` (the package price). Its components live in
  `webstore_bundle_items`, each pointing at a real product SKU with a `qty`,
  `size_required` flag, optional component decoration, and a `takes_number`
  flag (which components carry the player's jersey number).
- **On the storefront**, adding a bundle to the cart opens a configurator: one
  size selector per `size_required` component (and per unit when `qty > 1` — two
  jerseys can be different sizes), the number picker once (if enabled), and
  player name. One-size components (socks, backpack) skip the size step.
- **In the cart/order**, the bundle expands into `webstore_order_items`:
  - one **bundle-parent line** (`is_bundle_parent=true`, carries the package
    `unit_price`),
  - one **component line per item/unit** (`unit_price=0`, with its own `size`),
  - all sharing a `bundle_ref` and `bundle_product_id`.
- **Stock/ETA** is checked per component SKU+size, same logic as singles. If any
  component is out, the bundle shows the worst-case state ("Arriving ~Jun 12"
  for the slowest component) but stays orderable as backorder.
- **Batching** sends each component to the SO as its own pick line (with the
  bundle name + player in the note), so production sees real garments to make,
  while revenue/fundraise attaches to the parent line. The package therefore
  fulfills correctly without a fake "bundle SKU" in inventory.

## Jersey numbers (optional, with uniqueness)

Per-store toggles on `webstores`:

- `number_enabled` — turn number selection on/off for the whole store.
- `number_unique` — when on, a number claimed by one player is **blocked for
  everyone else** in that store; when off, duplicates are allowed.
- `number_min` / `number_max` — the allowed range (default 0–99).

**How uniqueness is enforced (no race conditions):**

- The storefront shows live availability by reading `webstore_number_claims` for
  the store — taken numbers render greyed-out in the picker.
- At checkout, the claim is inserted **inside the same transaction** as the
  order. The `UNIQUE (store_id, player_number)` constraint is the real guard: if
  two parents grab #10 at the same instant, the second insert fails and that
  checkout is told "number just taken — pick another," rather than relying on
  the UI alone.
- The chosen number is written to `player_number` on every line that has a
  `takes_number` component (and on single-item jersey lines), so it flows to the
  coach roster, the SO pick line, and the decoration.
- If a store has `number_unique=false`, we skip the claim insert entirely and
  duplicates are fine.

---

## Order → Sales Order batching

`netlify/functions/webstore-batch-so.js` (new):

- Input: `{ store_id, mode: 'manual' | 'scheduled' }`.
- Pulls all `webstore_orders` for that store with `status IN ('paid','unpaid')` and `so_id IS NULL`.
- Groups them into **one** `sales_orders` row (customer = the club), with `so_items` aggregated by (sku, size, decoration). Each underlying `webstore_order_items.player_name`/`player_number` becomes a pick-line note so personalization survives.
- Sets `webstore_orders.so_id` on each contributing order; sets `webstore_orders.status='batched'`.
- Writes `source='webstore'` and `webstore_id=<id>` columns on `sales_orders` (small additive migration to `sales_orders`).
- Returns SO id; rep then proceeds to the normal portal SO flow (decoration assignment, PO, ShipStation).

Scheduling: a Supabase scheduled edge function (`webstore-scheduler`) runs every
15 min, looks at `webstores.so_creation` and `so_next_run_at`, and invokes the
batch endpoint for stores whose window has hit. Manual mode just skips the
scheduler and exposes a "Batch now" button in the portal store-detail view.

---

## Payment flow

**Paid (parent checkout):**
1. Cart → `webstore-checkout` function creates a Stripe PaymentIntent (reuses `stripe-payment.js` plumbing).
2. Stripe webhook → flips `webstore_orders.status='paid'` and emails receipt via Brevo proxy.
3. Tax via existing `taxcloud-lookup` / `taxcloud-capture` edge functions.

**Unpaid (coach order):**
1. Cart → `webstore-checkout` writes the order with `payment_mode='unpaid'`, `status='unpaid'`.
2. No Stripe interaction. Confirmation email tells the coach the items will be added to the team's invoice.
3. Batches into the same SO as paid orders, but those line items are flagged for invoice rather than capture.

**Mixed store (`payment_mode='either'`):** parent picks at checkout; coach can also "place on team tab" if logged in as the store's coach.

---

## Fundraising

- Per-store toggle (`fundraise_enabled`) + either `fundraise_pct` or `fundraise_flat`.
- On add-to-cart, retail shown = `webstore_products.retail_price` (the markup is *already baked in* when the store was set up — simpler than runtime math, and matches how OMG works today).
- The `fundraise_amt` is computed at checkout as `retail_price - base_price` from `products.retail` reference, stored per line in `webstore_order_items.unit_fundraise` and summed onto `webstore_orders.fundraise_amt`.
- Store-detail page in the portal shows running `fundraise_total` (sum over the store's orders), matching the existing `omg_stores.fundraise_total` UX so coaches see one number.
- Payout to the club happens through the existing customer-credits flow (migration 005) — a "Disburse fundraising" button creates a credit memo for the club for the accumulated fundraise total.

---

## Portal UI additions

Two new screens (added to `src/App.js` nav, gated to staff):

1. **Webstores list** — table of all stores with status, sales, fundraise total, "Batch now" / "Open store" / "Close store" actions.
2. **Webstore detail** — three tabs:
   - **Catalog**: add/remove `webstore_products`, set price and decoration.
   - **Orders**: live list of `webstore_orders` with paid/unpaid filter, manual batch button.
   - **Settings**: payment_mode, so_creation, fundraise toggle, open/close dates, branding.

These reuse existing portal components (`OrderEditor`, product picker from `AiInventoryPoWizard`, decoration picker from `OrderEditor`).

---

## Coach order-tracking portal

The coach gets a **roster-style view of their store's orders** — not the
internal SO. This extends the existing `CoachPortal.js` (which already renders
SO/job statuses with the `prodLabelsP` labels and email open-tracking) rather
than building a new app.

New tab in `CoachPortal` — "Team Store" — visible when the logged-in coach is
the `coach_user_id` on one or more `webstores` (or the store's club is one of
the coach's `customers`):

- **Per-player order table**, one row per buyer (grouped from `webstore_orders`
  + `webstore_order_items` for that store):

  | Player / Buyer | Number | Items | Paid? | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Jordan M. (#12) | 12 | Jersey M, Hoodie L | Paid | In Production |
  | Casey R. (#7)   | 7  | Jersey S          | Unpaid (team tab) | In Line |

  - **Number** = `webstore_order_items.player_number`.
  - **Status** = `line_status`, kept in sync from the parent SO's job status
    (see sync note below). Shows the same friendly labels the coach already
    sees elsewhere (In Line / In Production / Shipped / Done).
  - **Paid?** = `payment_mode` + `status` (Paid via Stripe, or "Team tab" for
    unpaid coach orders).

- **Summary header**: total orders, total players ordered, fundraise running
  total, and — when a roster has been uploaded for the store (see below) — a
  **"# not yet ordered"** count plus the list of players still missing.
- **Filters**: by status, paid/unpaid, by player.
- **Coach is read-only.** They cannot change production status, batch orders,
  or close the store — that is all staff-only. The coach view exists purely to
  watch. The only outbound action a coach can take is **nudging players who
  haven't ordered** (resend the store link) and exporting the roster as CSV.

### Optional roster (per store)

Roster upload is **opt-in per store** — a store works fine without one. When a
coach (or staff) uploads a roster, the "not yet ordered" tracking turns on;
otherwise the coach view simply shows who *has* ordered and omits that count.

New table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE webstore_roster (
  id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  store_id    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES webstores(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  player_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  player_number TEXT,
  parent_email TEXT,            -- optional, used for "nudge" reminders
  ordered     BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,  -- flipped true once a matching order lands
  UNIQUE (store_id, player_name, player_number)
);
```

A roster row is matched to an order by `player_name` (+ number when present) on
any `webstore_order_items` for the store; the match flips `ordered=true`. The
"not yet ordered" list is just `webstore_roster WHERE ordered=false`. Upload is
a CSV (name, number, parent email) in the portal store-detail screen.

**Status sync (single source of truth):** the SO created by batching is the
real fulfillment record. A small reconciler (runs inside the existing SO
status-update path, or a Supabase trigger on `sales_orders` job changes) maps
the SO/job status back down to every `webstore_order_items.line_status` whose
`order.so_id` matches. So when staff move the SO to "In Production", every
linked player line — and thus the coach view and player portal — updates
automatically. No separate status entry.

## Player order-status portal

When a parent/player checks out, the confirmation email (Brevo, via existing
`brevo-proxy`) includes a **status link**:
`/shop/:slug/order/:id?t=<status_token>`.

- Public route, no login — the unguessable `status_token` authorizes read
  access to that one order (RLS: `SELECT` on `webstore_orders` /
  `webstore_order_items` allowed when the request's token matches).
- Shows: items ordered (with size, number, decoration), amount paid (or "on
  team tab"), and the live per-line `line_status` with the same step labels.
- A simple status timeline: Ordered → In Production → Shipped → Delivered,
  plus tracking number once ShipStation returns it (we already pull tracking
  via `ups-tracking` / ShipStation shipment data).
- For backordered lines, shows the ETA from `product_eta` ("Arriving ~Jun 12").
- "Notify me when it ships" is implicit — we email on each status change to the
  buyer_email on file (reuses the scheduled-email / Brevo plumbing).

Both portals read the **same** `line_status` field, so coach and player never
disagree, and neither can see cost/vendor data — only the storefront-safe
columns.

## Customer-facing storefront

New route tree under `src/storefront/` (lazy-loaded so it doesn't bloat the portal bundle):

- `/shop/:slug` — landing + product grid (uses `storefront_products` view)
- `/shop/:slug/p/:sku` — PDP for a single item (size grid + stock state per size)
- `/shop/:slug/b/:bundleId` — bundle configurator (per-component size pickers, number, player name)
- `/shop/:slug/cart` — cart
- `/shop/:slug/checkout` — Stripe Elements (paid) or contact form (unpaid).
  The buyer is often a **parent**, so the cart/checkout always captures a
  **player name** (and optional number) **per line item** — distinct from the
  buyer's own name/email. One parent can order for multiple players in a single
  checkout; each cart line carries its own `player_name` / `player_number`,
  which is what surfaces in the coach roster view and on the SO pick line.
- `/shop/:slug/order/:id?t=<status_token>` — player order-status portal (see above)

Subdomain routing: `*.shop.nsasports.com` rewrites in `netlify.toml` map subdomain → `slug` query param so each club can have its own URL while sharing one deploy.

## Build order (recommended)

1. **Schema + RLS** (migration 011). Validate column names against live DB during this step (`po_lines`, `products.size_stock`, etc.).
2. **Portal "Webstores" admin screens** (read-only first: list + detail showing catalog).
3. **Storefront product grid + PDP** reading the `storefront_products` view. No cart yet — just verify inventory + ETA display.
4. **Bundles** — rep builds packages (`webstore_bundle_items`) in the Catalog tab; storefront bundle configurator with per-component sizing.
5. **Jersey numbers** — store toggles + number picker with live availability and the `webstore_number_claims` uniqueness guard.
6. **Cart + unpaid checkout** end-to-end (handles singles + bundles + number claim in one transaction).
7. **Manual SO batching** — `webstore-batch-so` function + "Batch now" button (expands bundle components into pick lines).
8. **Player order-status portal** — `/shop/:slug/order/:id?t=` route + status email on checkout (Brevo).
9. **Status reconciler** — SO/job status → `webstore_order_items.line_status` (trigger or hook in existing SO update path).
10. **Coach "Team Store" tab** in `CoachPortal.js` — per-player order table reading `line_status` (read-only); optional `webstore_roster` CSV upload + "not yet ordered" tracking + nudge.
11. **Stripe paid checkout** — reuse `stripe-payment.js`.
12. **Scheduled batching** — `webstore-scheduler` edge function.
13. **Fundraising** — pricing math + portal rollup + credit-memo disbursement.
14. **Backorder "notify me"** capture + email when stock lands (hook into existing PO-received flow).
15. **Status-change emails** to buyers + subdomain routing + theming.

Each step is independently shippable behind a feature flag on `webstores.status='draft'` — a store stays invisible to the public until staff flips it to `open`.

## Decisions made

- **Roster:** opt-in per store. When uploaded, drives the coach's "not yet
  ordered" tracking; stores without one just show who has ordered.
- **Coach permissions:** read-only. No batching, no closing, no status edits —
  all staff-only (we batch SOs and close stores). Coach can nudge non-orderers
  and export CSV.
- **Buyer vs. player:** buyer is often a parent; checkout always captures a
  player name per line item (number optional), so coach roster + SO pick lines
  carry the player identity even when the payer is someone else.
- **Catalog curation:** the **rep picks the SKUs** for each store (no
  auto-include of past products). The store-detail "Catalog" tab is a rep tool;
  coaches don't edit it.
- **Bundles/packages:** supported. A package is one priced catalog item made of
  multiple component SKUs; the buyer sizes each component independently and the
  package fulfills as separate pick lines. Reps build bundles in the Catalog tab.
- **Jersey numbers:** optional per store (`number_enabled`). When uniqueness is
  on (`number_unique`), a number is one-per-store, enforced by a DB unique
  constraint on claims (not just UI), with taken numbers greyed out live. Both
  the toggle and uniqueness are per-store settings.
- **Fundraising:** **optional per store** (`fundraise_enabled=false` by
  default). When a rep turns it on, set the percent/flat markup. A second
  per-store toggle `fundraise_show_parents` controls whether parents see the
  "$X supports the team" line at checkout (default off — markup is just baked
  into the price). Stores can run with no fundraising at all.
- **Shipping:** **ship only** for v1 — every order collects a ship address and
  goes through ShipStation. No in-store pickup option. (`webstore_orders.ship_method`
  stays in the schema for a future pickup mode but is always `'ship'` now.)
- **Order types — both supported, can coexist in one store:**
  1. **Individual paid orders** — a parent/player checks out and **pays by card**
     (Stripe). Each is its own `webstore_orders` row, `payment_mode='paid'`,
     `order_kind='individual'`.
  2. **Bulk / invoice-later orders** — a coach (or staff on their behalf) places
     a larger order with **no card charge**; it's invoiced to the club afterward.
     `payment_mode='unpaid'`, `order_kind='bulk'`.

  A single store can offer both at once via `webstores.payment_mode='either'`:
  the storefront lets a parent pay individually, while the coach/staff path can
  drop a bulk order onto the team invoice. Both kinds **batch into the same SO**
  (so fulfillment is one job); the paid lines are already settled, the bulk
  lines carry to the club invoice. New column:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE webstore_orders ADD COLUMN order_kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'individual';
  -- 'individual' (one buyer, usually paid) | 'bulk' (coach/team, invoiced later)
  ```

- **Invoicing bulk orders:** **rep-triggered, on demand.** Bulk/unpaid lines
  accumulate on the club's tab; the SO can be created (batched) independently of
  billing. A rep clicks **"Invoice club"** on the store-detail screen whenever
  they choose — once, or in stages — and that generates the invoice for the
  outstanding bulk total via the existing customer-invoice flow (migrations
  007/008). Nothing auto-charges at batch or at store close.

## Storefront look & theming

Per-store branding is **template-driven**, not hand-built per club. There is
**one** storefront React app (`src/storefront/`) with a single, well-designed
layout that reads each store's branding fields at runtime:

- `webstores.logo_url`, `primary_color`, `hero_blurb` (already in the schema)
  drive the header, accent color, and landing copy.
- Add a few more presentational columns as needed: `banner_url`, `accent_color`,
  `theme` (e.g. `'classic' | 'bold' | 'minimal'` — a small set of layout presets
  the rep picks from a dropdown).

So a rep spins up a new club store by filling in name, logo, colors, and picking
a theme preset — no code, no per-store design work. Every store shares the same
tested, responsive, accessible components; only the skin changes. This keeps all
stores consistent to maintain and lets us improve the storefront once for
everyone.

Recommendation: I (Claude) build the **template + 2–3 theme presets** once, wired
to those branding columns. That's the right division of labor — code is a
build-once asset, whereas designing each club store by hand would be repetitive
manual work better handled by the rep filling in branding fields. If you later
want richer per-store visuals (custom hero images, section ordering), we extend
the preset system rather than forking the app.
